# Red Black Tree
Exercise where a [red-black tree](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rot-Schwarz-Baum) is implemented and insertions are visualized utilizing the
[graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) software.

## Rules for RB-Trees
1. Every Node is *either* red or black
2. The root of the tree is *black*
3. All null-leafs are black
4. A red node must not have red children
5. All paths from a node to a leaf contain the same amount of black nodes

## Getting started
Instructions for getting up and running will be added in time.
