/**
 * RBTree represents a Red-Black-Tree, a binary search tree that allows
 * fast access to stored elements. This is accomplished by following five rules:
 * 1. Every Node is either red or black
 * 2. The root of the tree is black
 * 3. All null-leafs are black
 * 4. A red node must not have red children
 * 5. All paths from a node to a leaf contain the same amount of black nodes
